# CSC 380 Project 2 - Secure(?) Chat

## Concept
Develop an asymmetric system based on RSA, leveraging the GMP library for handling arbitrary precision numbers. Simultaneously, construct a symmetric system labeled as SKE, which functions exclusively on buffers and files. The following implementations should be made:
- Write some sort of handshake protocol to setup ephemeral keys (your protocol should have perfect forward secrecy!).
- Mutual authentication, using public key cryptography.
- After authentication, each message should be encrypted and tagged with a message authentication code. You may also want to take measures to prevent replay attacks.


You should now be able to communicate on both terminals.
